R15 - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	  If you are going to be working on or accessing projects and files across several devices, you would want to keep them in the remote repository.

R16 - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
	  stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	  
	  Because things in the remote might have been changed while you were working locally,
	  and these changes could interfere with your local work. Pulling changes manually
	  allows you to pull what you want when you want from the remote to your local repo.
