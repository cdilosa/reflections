R8 - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?
	 
	 I don't know. It didn't seem to work the same. It created the repository, but
	 there was no initial commit, and the only file in the directory was flagged as
	 not being tracked.
	 
R9 - How is the staging are different from the working directory and the repository?
	 What value do you think it offers?
	 
	 The staging area is where files that are going to be committed are held. It is
	 an intermediate area between the repository and the working directory. The staging
	 area allows you to "bundle" the files that you want to put in a single commit.


	 
Commands

	 git init	// create git repository in current directory
	 ls -a		// show hidden files in directory
	 git status	// show the status of a directory
	 git add {file name} // Add the file from the working directory to the staging area
	 git commit {file name} // Commit the staged file(s)
