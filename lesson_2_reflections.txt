R8 - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?
	 
	 I don't know. It didn't seem to work the same. It created the repository, but
	 there was no initial commit, and the only file in the directory was flagged as
	 not being tracked.
	 
	 Commands
	 git init	// create git repository in current directory
	 ls -a		// show hidden files in directory
	 git status	// show the status of a directory
